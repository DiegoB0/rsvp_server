### Running the server

```bash
make run
```

### Creating migrations

Migrations are located in `cmd/migrate/migrations`.

### 1. Create a new migration

```bash
make migrate-create name=create_users_table
```

This will generate something like this:

```bash
cmd/migrate/migrations/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250529220000_create_users_table.up.sql
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250529220000_create_users_table.down.sql

```

### 2. Create the sql

Once you've created the migrations just create the table with sql.

Example: `create_users_table.up.sql`:

```bash
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (

  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(250) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
);

```

Example: `create_users_table.down.sql`:

```bash

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;


```

### 3. Run the migration

```bash
make migrate-up
```

## üê≥ Docker integration

The project supports a docker-based development setup using make.

### ‚úÖ Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ‚Äì Containerization platform
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) ‚Äì Tool to run predefined scripts easily

```bash
make docker-dev
```

## üìÑ API Documentation

Once the project is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

```bash
http://localhost:PORT/swagger/index.html
```

Replace PORT with the one your server is running on (e.g., 8080).
All API documentation is available there.
